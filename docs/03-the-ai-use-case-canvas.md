  Title: The AI Use Case Canvas: A Structured Framework for Evaluating and Prioritizing AI Initiatives
  
  Message: Do not get into the hype of shiny new "toys" in AI. Focus on practical application in banking. Only use agentic AI solutions when they clearly add value over simpler AI/ML or non-AI/ML approaches.

  Purpose: Produce a clear, structured, and engaging white paper that explains the use of AI Use Case Canvas as a framework for evaluating and prioritizing AI initiatives in banking.

  Goals:
    - Explain the concept and components of the AI Use Case Canvas.
    - Illustrate how it can be applied specifically in the banking sector (give examples relevant to retail banking).
    - Provide practical recommendations for banks to implement the framework effectively.

  Audience: Technical product managers, architects, and senior banking executives (mix of technical and non-technical readers).

  Tone: Clear, authoritative, moderately technical, accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

  Length & structure:
    - Target: ~1000–1500 words.
    - Use Mermaid for illustrative diagrams.
    - Citations must be included as inline references with footnotes in Markdown (e.g., [^2]).
    - Citations should include links.
    - Do not bold headings.

  Sections:
    - 1) executive summary (100–150 words)
    - 2) introduction
    - 3) fundamentals:
      - Explain the fundamentals of a "Business Use Case Canvas" (basis of the AI Use Case Canvas).
    - 4) Topics:
      - Explain each component of the AI Use Case Canvas in detail:
        - The Why Dimension: Building the Business Case
          - Business Problem
          - Business Value
          - KPIs
        - The How Dimension: Implementation Strategy
          - Data Requirements
          - AI Approach
          - Implementation Approach
        - The Cost Dimension: Understanding the Full Picture
          - Complexity
          - Risks
      - Provide banking-specific examples for each component (focus on retail banking).
    - 5) Recommendations and roadmap:
      - Use the AI Use Case Canvas to drive AI decision-making in banks.
    - 6) short conclusion

  Examples & requirements:
    - Provide a 3-point recommended roadmap (short-, mid-, long-term).
    - Focus more on retail banking
    - No specific banks, jurisdictions, or regulations

  Constraints: Avoid vendor promotion, unrealistic timelines, or speculative claims without caveats.
