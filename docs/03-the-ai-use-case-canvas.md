  Title: The AI Use Case Canvas: A Structured Framework for Evaluating and Prioritizing AI Initiatives

  Message: Avoid AI hype and focus on practical, value-driven application in banking. Use agentic AI solutions only when they demonstrably add value over simpler AI/ML or non-AI/ML approaches. The AI Use Case Canvas is a structured tool for making this evaluation and prioritization decision.

  Purpose: Produce a clear, structured, and actionable white paper that explains the AI Use Case Canvas as a practical framework for evaluating, comparing, and prioritizing AI initiatives in retail banking.

  Goals:
    - Explain the fundamentals of the Business Use Case Canvas and its evolution to the AI Use Case Canvas.
    - Describe each component of the canvas in detail (Why, How, and Cost dimensions) with banking-specific examples.
    - Demonstrate how to use the canvas to compare AI solutions and decide between agentic, ML, or non-AI approaches.
    - Provide concrete, step-by-step guidance for banks implementing the framework.
    - Offer a realistic 3-point roadmap (short / mid / long term) for canvas adoption and maturity.

  Audience: Technical product managers, architects, and senior banking executives (mix of technical and non-technical readers).

  Tone: Clear, authoritative, moderately technical; pragmatic and decision-focused with accessible explanations for non-technical stakeholders.

  Length & structure:
    - Target: ~1000–1500 words.
    - Use headings, short paragraphs, bullets, and one illustrative Mermaid diagram.
    - Include inline citations with footnotes in Markdown (e.g., [^2]) with full links.
    - Do not bold headings.

  Sections (required):
    - 1) Executive summary (100–150 words)
    - 2) Introduction: context and the problem of prioritizing AI investments
    - 3) Fundamentals: Business Use Case Canvas origins and its application to AI
    - 4) The AI Use Case Canvas in detail:
      - The Why Dimension: Building the Business Case
        - Business Problem
        - Business Value
        - Success metrics (KPIs)
      - The How Dimension: Implementation Strategy
        - Data Requirements
        - AI/ML Approach (including decision logic for agentic vs traditional vs non-AI)
        - Implementation Approach (timeline, effort, dependencies)
      - The Cost Dimension: Understanding Trade-Offs
        - Complexity and effort
        - Risks (technical, operational, regulatory)
        - ROI and payback period
    - 5) Banking-specific examples: Apply the canvas to 2–3 concrete retail banking use cases (e.g., dispute resolution, customer segmentation, fraud detection)
    - 6) Recommendations and 3-point roadmap (short-, mid-, long-term) for deploying the canvas
    - 7) Conclusion

  Examples & requirements:
    - Include at least 1 detailed banking use case example (Agent-to-Agent Customer Service Interaction).
    - For at least one example, show a side-by-side comparison of canvas evaluations for an agentic AI approach vs a simpler alternative.
    - Provide a 3-point recommended roadmap (short-, mid-, long-term) for canvas adoption and organizational maturity.
    - Include one Mermaid diagram illustrating the canvas structure or a completed canvas example.

  Constraints: Avoid vendor promotion, unrealistic timelines, and unsupported claims. Emphasize practicality, measurable value, and honest risk assessment. Do not prescribe specific technologies or vendors.
