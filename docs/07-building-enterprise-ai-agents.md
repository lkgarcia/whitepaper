  Title: Building Enterprise AI Agents: Empowering Business Units Through Secure, Scalable, and Compliant AI Platforms
  
  Message: Use these AI architecture patterns and governance frameworks.

  Purpose: Produce a clear, structured, and engaging white paper that explains [TBD:What?].

  Goals:
    - Explain the technical fundamentals of building enterprise-grade AI agents.
    - Survey the current landscape of agent development environments (IDEs), including traditional and low-code/no-code platforms.
    - Elaborate various technical architecture patterns for building enterprise-grade AI agents that meet banking requirements for security, scalability, and compliance.
    - Elaborate vendor solutions:
      - Microsoft 365 Copilot Agents
      - Azure Databricks
    - Provide a decision framework for selecting appropriate agent development platforms and architecture patterns based on use case requirements.

  Audience: Technical product managers, architects, and senior banking executives (mix of technical and non-technical readers).

  Tone: Clear, authoritative, moderately technical, accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

  Length & structure:
    - Target: ~1200–1600 words.
    - Use headings, short paragraphs, bullets, and one illustrative diagrams using Mermaid.
    - Citations must be included as inline references with footnotes in Markdown (e.g., [^2])
    - Do not bold headings.

  Sections:
    - 1) executive summary (100–150 words)
    - 2) introduction
    - 3) technical fundamentals:
      - [TBD: What 2-3 technical fundamentals need to be explained?]
    - 4) Topics:
      - Agent development/IDE:
        - traditional / code-first Pplatforms (e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
        - low-code/no-code platforms (e.g. Microsoft Copilot Studio, n8n, etc.)
      - Architecture patterns for building secure, scalable, compliant AI agents:
        - Agentic Knowledge Management (use cases: knowledge & service intelligence in contact centre, internal advisory, etc.)
        - Agentic Process Automation (use cases: business process & operations automation
        - Agentic Risk Management (use cases: risk & fraud decision augmentation, etc.)
        - Agentic Customer Engagement (use cases: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) customer engagement & personalization, etc.)
      - Decision framework for selecting agent development platforms and architecture patterns
      - Case studies / examples
    - 5) Recommendations and roadmap
    - 6) short conclusion

  Examples & requirements:
    - Provide a 3-point recommended roadmap (short-, mid-, long-term).
    - Focus more on retail banking
    - No specific banks, jurisdictions, or regulations

  Constraints: Avoid vendor promotion, unrealistic timelines, or speculative claims without caveats.
