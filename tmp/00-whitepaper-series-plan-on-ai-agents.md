# Whitepaper Series Plan on AI Agents

## Goal
This whitepaper series explores the foundations, enablers, and applications of AI agents—examining how they can be designed, secured, and deployed to perform complex tasks autonomously while aligning with business and governance objectives.

### What?
- A series of in-depth explanatory whitepapers on AI agents.
- Topics: Foundational concepts; technical and strategic enablement; industry and business applications; enterprise integration and governance.
- Target audience: executives and technical professionals.

### Why?
- Help organizations make informed decisions about adopting AI agents by answering practical questions such as:
  - Do we need AI agents for our use case?
  - Do the benefits outweigh the risks and costs?
  - Which AI solutions and architectures best fit our needs?
  - How do we design, deploy, and govern AI agents effectively?

### How?
- Provide a comprehensive understanding of AI agents.
- Explain risks and security considerations.
- Equip readers with practical frameworks and tools to evaluate AI use cases.
- Survey AI solutions and trade-offs across models and architectures.
- Offer actionable guidance on design, security, and deployment.
